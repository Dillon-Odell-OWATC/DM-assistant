Application Name: DM assistant 
The purpose of this application is to assist the DM in finding information for the campaign quickly.
I plan to use streamread and streamwrite to create and read txt files. When it reads the txt file it will create a object that will be put in a list to be selected from to show the data. When it writes it will write the file in a way it will be able to read it and show it as a object. 
Comments 
Depending on time the scope of this project may change to be larger or smaller. Dave has given me power to make calls on what to add or take away.
